Import original_relaxed.pdb into pymol and remove H3 loop (starts at around 94 with residues starting YYCAR and ending WGQGT)

Make mesh in pymol with starting pdb structure without H3 with following parameters:

surface_solvent on
solvent_radius 1.0

Hide everything in pymol EXCEPT mesh and set view coordinates as true coordinates using set_view command and following input parameters:
set_view(1,0,0,
	 0,1,0,
	 0,0,1,
	 0,0,0,
	 0,0,0,
	 0,0,0)

Save pymol scene as wrl file and and use get_mesh.sh and print_mesh.py to get a final npy file of the mesh
