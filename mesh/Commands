1) Open Pymol. Select the residues in chain A (starting YYCAR and ending WGQGT). Right click and remove => Check that they are removed from the sequence.
2) In the 'H' command, hide everything. => in all
3) In the 'S' command, select surface.
4) Type => set surface_solvent, on
5) Type => set solvent_radius, 1.0
6) Type cmd.set_view("1.0,0.0,0.0 , 0.0,1.0,0.0 , 0.0,0.0,1.0 , 0.0,0.0,0.0 , 0.0,0.0,0.0 , 0.0,0.0,0.0")
7) Type cmd.save("5ggs_relaxed_wH_2a_surface.wrl")

Now run the .sh and py script
8) Run the .sh script normally.
9) To run the python scrip I had to create a conda environment.
	a) activate the environment by typing => conda activate mymayaviP2
	b) run the script => python print_mesh.py 5ggs_relaxed_wH_2a_surface_mesh.csv
	c) deactivate the environment => source deactivate mymayaviP2
